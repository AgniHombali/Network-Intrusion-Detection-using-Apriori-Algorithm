# Network-Intrusion-Detection-using-Apriori-Algorithm
This is my project which involves a method of Network Intrusion Detection using Apriori Algorithm. The source code of the project is written in the Python programming language. This is an attempt to combine the concepts of data mining and cyber security to detect network intrusions.
